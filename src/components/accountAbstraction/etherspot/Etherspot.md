# Account Abstraction on Ethereum


## Overview

Account abstraction in Ethereum enhances the EVM by allowing more flexible and functional transactions and smart contracts. It blurs the line between Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and contract accounts, enabling new "contract-type accounts" that can hold both code and ether, and execute transactions directly.

### Benefits
- **Enhanced Efficiency:** Reduces transaction and storage operations, lowering gas costs.
- **Improved Privacy:** Enables private transactions within smart contracts.
- **Flexible Fee Models:** Contracts can pay fees for users, allowing for subscriptions and microtransactions.
- **Custom Transaction Semantics:** Allows contracts to define unique rules for transactions, enabling complex interactions.

Account abstraction streamlines operations, enhances privacy, and provides flexible transaction models, significantly advancing Ethereum's capabilities.
